A [Flarum](http://flarum.org) extension.

Replaces iframe YouTube embeds from ![`fof/formatting`](https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/formatting) with a lightweight embed implementation using ![`lite-youtube`](https://github.com/justinribeiro/lite-youtube).

Th `MediaEmbed` option in `fof/formatting` must be enabled for this extension to work.

## Installation

```sh
composer require sycho/flarum-lite-youtube:"*"
```

## Updating

## Support
This extension is under minimal maintenance.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.
